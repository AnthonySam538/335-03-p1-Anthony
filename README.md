## Introduction
This is a variant of Langton's Ant. This ant resides in a 41 × 41 grid and its movements are defined by the color of the tile it currently stands on. If the ant is standing on a black, yellow, or green tile, then the ant will turn 90 degrees counterclockwise, change the color of the tile to the next color, and then move 1 tile forward. If the ant is standing on a red or blue tile, then the ant will instead turn 90 degrees clockwise before incrementing the tile's color and moving 1 tile forward. Also, when the ant changes the color of the tile to the next color, the cycle is as follows: Black → Red → Yellow → Blue → Green → Black again. Initially, all tiles are black, and the ant is in the center of the grid, facing towards the top. Also, the ant will wrap around to the other side of the grid whenever necessary.

## Contents
* ant.js - Contains the programming for the ant (Requires the stuff in p5.js to work)
* main.html - Combines all of the files together (except README.txt) into one html page
* p5.js - Contains a bunch of functions and such
* README.txt - Detailed information about the project (You're reading this file right now)
* style.css - Supplemental visual details used by main.html

## Features
